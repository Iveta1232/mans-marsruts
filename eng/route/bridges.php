								<p>
								A bridge is the quickest way to cross from one side to the other over water. 
								The bridge connects the two coasts - different districts, houses, people's lives. 
							  </p><br>
								<p>
								My route to and from the university takes me over 1 large bridge and 1 small bridge.
								The small bridge is in Opera Square, which is at the end of my route. The bridge connects 2 parts of the park.
								Under the bridge, on the Daugava Canal, you can often see small boats with tourists looking at Riga from the water. 
								The Stone Bridge has beautiful sunrises and sunsets. Have you ever looked at them there? If so, there is definitely something to remember. 
								At sunrise, the sun highlights the Railway Bridge, and at sunset - the Vansu Bridge. And those moments are really beautiful!
								Sometimes, when I have free time and the desire, I walk across the bridge. What could be better than sunshine, a little breeze and a beautiful 360-degree panorama?

									On my way to the university, I cross 2 bridges - the Stone Bridge and the small bridge in Opera Square. Below you can see pictures of the bridges.
