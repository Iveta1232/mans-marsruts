								<h2>Old Town Riga</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="text-center">
								<p>
								The old town is the heart of the new city. Every stone holds the town' s history. Small streets, colourful houses, cafés, restaurants and tourists are all part of the city.
							  </p><br>
								<p>
								What could be better than a walk in the fresh air? I think that every tourist visiting Riga should take a walk through the old town and get a feel for its atmosphere.
								Definitely visit a café, eat a pastry and have a cup of coffee or tea.
							  </p><br>
								<p>
								Back to my road from home to university. I get off at the 11.novembra krastmala stop and go to the Old Town. It varies in the morning, midday and evening. For example, in the morning, around 8 o'clock, people are running to work, few tourists and almost everything is still closed.
								But both at midday and in the evening, the Old Town is full of people. Everyone is going somewhere - some are just walking and taking pictures, some are looking for a place to sit and eat, some want to buy something in the shops. 
								</p><br>
								<p>
								My route takes me through the Old Town. And below you can see various pictures of the Old Town.
