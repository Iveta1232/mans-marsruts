								<p>
								A café is a place where you can do many things. You can eat, work and take a break. Each person enters the café with his or her own thought or purpose. 
								I think it's a pretty universal place.
							  </p><br>
								<p>
								I don't see cafés on the bus, but when I get off the bus and walk through the Old Town - yes. 
								When I have more free time, I can change my daily route a little and go for a walk in the Old Town. Walking through its streets, you can find a lot of different cafés, restaurants and shops.
								All cafés have their own design and style. So everyone can find their favourite place.
								For me personally, I like Double Coffee, which is located near the "Laima" watches. It has delicious food and comfortable sofas, and in the summer customers can sit outside on the terrace.
								Sometimes I take my coffee with me and continue my route, sometimes I choose to sit inside and take a rest or prepare for university.

								<p>
									Walking around the Old Town, I come across many cafes. Below you can see pictures of some of the cafés.
