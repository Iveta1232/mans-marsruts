								<p>
								It's usually said that to really get to know a city, you have to walk. That's the only way to feel it and discover it for yourself. When we walk, we see much more than from a transport window. 
								You can feel the history of a city in every sight.

								<p>
								The first attraction - Agenskalns Market - is at my first stop on the way to the university. After quite a long renovation process, it recently opened its doors to its customers.
								Now, when you go home in the evening, you can see a lot of people in the market and around, wanting to buy something tasty. 
							  </p><br>
								<p>
								On the bus, I see two more sights on the way - the Victory Monument in Victory Park and the National Library of Latvia.
								The National Library of Latvia is a really interesting building. When I look at it, it reminds me a big iceberg of knowledge. There is a little 'tail' at the top of the library - that is what is above the water and visible to people. And the rest of the body is the part of the iceberg that is under the water and not visible to people. In this way, you can also think about knowledge - the more you learn, the more and more new things you discover.
								</p><br>
								<p>
									Near the university, there are two other sights - the Milda Monument and the Latvian National Opera.
								</p><br>
								<p>
								I meet 5 sights along the route. I think that's quite a big number. You can see pictures of the sights below.
